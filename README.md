**1.Description**

This project demonstrates how to use Pygame to create a gradient design with various shapes. The shapes (circles, rectangles, and squares) are drawn on the screen with colors that change smoothly from the top to the bottom, creating a gradient effect. The color components (red, green, and blue) are calculated based on the vertical position of the shapes.

**2.Installation**

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using pip:
*pip install pygame*
